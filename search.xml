    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Have you ever met this kind of situation, you are watching a short video which is very intresting that you want to dowload it, but you can’t find the download button. Today I am going to teach you a method which can dowload the videos on web pages. First, you need to open the “developer tools”, it will be find on the upper right corner for most browsers. Take google browser for example, you will find it according to the picture below. Then according to the arrows in the below picture, select “network” —- select “filter” —- write “.mp4” in the searching box —- right click mouse on the .mp4 file —- open in new tab Now, you will find the new tab is playing the video that you want to download, left click the button on the bottom right corner as the picture below, here you are, you will find the download button. For youtube channel you can check this method. Copy the link of youtube video and input it in a new tab. Add “1s” after youtube in the link and push “Enter” key on your keyboard, for example, your video link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPQbKTJPsU4, after you added “1s” it should be like this https://www.youtube1s.com/watch?v=HPQbKTJPsU4. You will find you can download the video or audio and you can choose different formats and different clarity.]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F15%2FNotes-about-STM32%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[​ On this note, I’m going to record some skills and something that require special attention when I was doing embedded projects. 《STM Community》 Recommend a good MCU learning website 《微雪课堂》 If you want to calculate the size of a string you can use the following method 12 #define COUNTOF(__BUFFER__) (sizeof(__BUFFER__) / sizeof(*(__BUFFER__)))HAL_UART_Transmit(&amp;huart6, ch1, (COUNTOF(ch1) - 1), 55); We can use sprintf() to combine different strings or numbers into on string, this string should be in a arry with char type. Besides, we can whatch this artical The different uses of sprintf() 12 sprintf(buf, &quot;CH1: %4d CH2: %4d CH3: %4d CH4: %4d SW1: %1d SW2: %1d \n&quot;, rc.ch1, rc.ch2, rc.ch3, rc.ch4, rc.sw1, rc.sw2);HAL_UART_Transmit(&amp;huart6, (uint8_t *)buf, (COUNTOF(buf) - 1), 55); STM32_UART_DMA_IDLE, If we want to use DMA and IDLE to recive data then we should open the IDLE interrupt and DMA reciver, what should noticed is that we can’t open the reciver interrupt of UART or it will always interrupt when reciving data. If UART don’t recive data for a moment time, which is the detection time of IDLE interrupt, then the timer will be shut down and the recive completion flag will be positioned, too. About STM32_UART_DMA_IDLE we can read the following artical 《STM32 USART串口DMA接收和发送模式》 《STM32使用DMA加串口空闲中断接收数据》 Note: This one is well 《Cube下实现串口+DMA+空闲中断接收不定长数据》 《关于STM32空闲中断》 How to config the CAN communication with STM32CubeMX. There are few points need to be noted. About STM32_CAN I will make a detailed record later. Baud rate. If your HCLK is 180, you can config Prescaler to 5, Time Quanta in Bit Segment 1 to 3 times, Time Quanta in Bit Segment 2 to 5 times and ReSynchronization Jump With to 1 time NVIC settings. Don’t forget to config the CAN_TX and CAN_RX interrupts, on this step, you will see two RX interrupts, RX0 and RX1, case CAN reciver contains two recive mailbox, we can associate the can reciver what we used with one of them. Filter setting. About this part I recommend this artical 《》 Recive &amp; Send. This part is a little different between old version library and new version library(after v1.20), we can refrence the demo of HAL library. There are some articals about CAN communication, which explained well. 《微雪课堂-STM32CubeMX系列教程12:控制器局域网络(CAN)》 《STM32之CAN – CAN ID过滤器分析》 《再谈STM32的CAN过滤器-bxCAN的过滤器的4种工作模式以及使用方法总结》 （Unfinished…）]]></content>

    <url>%2F2018%2F10%2F14%2FHow-to-Build-Your-Personal-Website-with-Github-and-Hexo%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[​ This is my first blog in this space, I want to record how I build my blog website. My blog is based on Hexo which hosted on Github. What is Hexo? ​ Before we started, I’m going to talk something about Hexo. Hexo is a static blog framework which based on Node.js, it has no so much depend on and very convenient for useing. It can generate static web pages and host them on Github or Heroku. meanwhile, Hexo is also a open source project on Github – hexojs/hexo. If you want to learn more about Hexo, you can go to the official website of Hexo.As for Github, I think you can no longer be familiar with it, so I will not talk too much on this part, but if you want to learn more about Git, You can check this aitical – 《Git使用教程》. I don’t want talk too much, so let’s get started.(In fact, I don’t know what to say, ha ha ha…) Install Node.js Because Hexo is based on Node.js, so we should install Node.js first. The download adrres is Download | Node.js. After installed, please check if install or not, you can run the following command in the shell, any path, and if your installation was no problem, it should return the version of Node.js. 1 node -v In addition, you should check if npm is also installed, cause we will use it to install different plugins in the later. Also you can use the following command and it will return the version, too. 1 npm -v Install Hexo Hexo is the framwork of our blog. Before we install Hexo, we need to creat a folder which will storage all files of this blog project, you can name this folder as “Blog”. After you have created this folder, you need to enter this folder then push the “shift” key and meanwhile right click the mouse, select the “command line” and run it. For Windows 10 user, you should select the “Powershell” and run it. (Attention: from now, all of our command will run in this folder.) Now, to install Hexo, you should run this command. 1 npm install -g hexo-cli After a little long time for installing Hexo, we need to use the following command to init our blog. 1 hexo init blog Now we can test our blog website use the following command. 123 hexo new this_is_a_test_articalhexo ghexo s When the above three commands are all excuted, we can open the browser and input the address: localhost:4000 . Then we can see the following image. This is your blog, but now, it just run on your own computer, and the next steps are to make your blog be hosted on Github. Creat a new repository on Github Log in to your Github and creat a new repository, what should be pay attention to specially is that the name of this repository should be: your_account_name _of_github.github.io, this is a fixed writing. For example, my repository name is elonhu001.github.io. Push your blog website This step is to push your website to Github, then it will be hosted by Github, when you finished this step, you can enter your website in a browser with this address: your_account_name _of_github.github.io. Now, please open the site configuration file, it is on this directory: /Blog/_config.yml. Open it and turn to the end, you will see the “deploy configration options”, you can modify it like the following. 1234 deploy: type: git repo: https://github.com/elonhu001/elonhu001.github.io.git branch: master The repo option should be the address of the repository you just created. To deploy your blog on Github repository, you should install Git plugin with the following command in your root directory. 1 npm install hexo-deployer-git --save Then, you can run the following commands in sequence. 123 hexo clean hexo g hexo d Now, please open your browser and input your blog address: your_account_name _of_github.github.io, you will find your blog is already on line surprisingly. Get your domain name You may think why your website address is a little strange and doesn’t like the others, www.xxxx.com or www.xxxx.cn. That is because you haven’t got your own domain name, so this step is to teach you how to get your own domain name. This is the only on step that you need to pay money. There are a lot of places to buy domain name, here I will recommend aliyun, you can register an account and buy your own domain name from here: aliyun_domain_name. Binding your domain name (Unfinished…)]]></content>
